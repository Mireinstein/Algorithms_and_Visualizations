      <h1>The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</h1>
      <h2>Algorithmic Development</h2>
      <p>
        The Prim function implements Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph. It takes as input a graph object and a visualization object, which is used to display the MST. 
        The algorithm starts by choosing a random starting vertex and putting it in the set S. It then adds all the neighbors of the current vertex to a priority queue, sorted by their edge weights.
         The algorithm then iteratively removes the edge with the minimum weight from the priority queue and checks if adding it to the MST would create a cycle. 
         If not, it adds the edge to the MST and adds the adjacent vertex to the set S. 
         The process continues until all vertices are in the set S. 
      </p>
      <p>The algorithm uses a variety of data structures including a priority queue, sets, and arrays to keep track of visited vertices, the current vertex, and the MST edges.
        The visualization object is used to highlight edges and vertices as they are added to the MST.</p>

        I also have two extra functions to help with the simulation of clicks inorder to create a random Graph.
        simulateClicks() simulates a random click event on an SVG element by generating random coordinates within the bounds of the element and 
        dispatching a click event with those coordinates using the dispatchEvent() method.
       simulateClickAt() simulates a click event on an SVG element at the top-left corner of the element by dispatching 
       a click event with clientX and clientY properties set to 0.
