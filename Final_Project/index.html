      <h1>The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</h1>

      <h2>Historical Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree">Minimum Spanning Tree</a> problem
        is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science that involves finding the minimum weight tree that spans a given graph. 
        The problem can be traced back to the early 20th century and has been studied extensively since then.
        Czech scientist Otakar Bor≈Øvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, in 1926.
        He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity. </p>

      <h2>Connection to the project</h2>
      <p>The goal of the project is to find a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
         We will use  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">Prim's algorithm</a>  to visualize this. The weights of the edges are based on the Euclidean distance between the two nodes</p>

         <h2>Technical Development</h2>
         <p>You can read more about the description of the major algorithmic components of the visualization <a href="readMe.html">here</a></p>

         <h2>Future Work</h2>
         <p>In the future, we plan to implement a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">Kruskal's</a> algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. We will also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing" target="_blank"> Force-directed</a> 
          graph drawing procedures to draw more aesthetically pleasing graphs</p>
