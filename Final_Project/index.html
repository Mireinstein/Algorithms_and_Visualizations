      <h1>Minimum Spanning Trees</h1>

      <h2>Historical Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The minimum spanning tree problem (MST) is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science that involves finding the minimum weight tree that spans a given graph. 
        The problem can be traced back to the early 20th century and has been studied extensively since then.
        Czech scientist Otakar Borůvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, in 1926.
        He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity. </p>

      <h2>Connection to the project</h2>
      <p>Finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
         I will use Kruskal and Prim&apos;s algorithm to visualize this.</p>

      <h2>How to Operate</h2>
      <p>
        Click on the grey canvas to add nodes; click two dots to add an edge between them and use either Kruskal or Prim’s algorithm to compute and visualize the minimum spanning tree.
