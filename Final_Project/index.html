      <h1>Minimum Spanning Trees</h1>

      <h2>Historical Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree">Minimum Spanning Tree</a> problem
        is a fundamental problem in graph theory and computer science that involves finding the minimum weight tree that spans a given graph. 
        The problem can be traced back to the early 20th century and has been studied extensively since then.
        Czech scientist Otakar Bor≈Øvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, in 1926.
        He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity. </p>

      <h2>Connection to the project</h2>
      <p>The goal of the project is to finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
         We will use Kruskal and Prim&apos;s algorithm to visualize this. The weights of the edges are based on the Euclidean distance between the two nodes</p>

      <h2>How to Operate</h2>
      <p>
        Click on the grey canvas to add nodes; click two dots to add an edge between them and use either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">Kruskal</a>
        or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">Prim's algorithm</a>
        to compute and visualize the minimum spanning tree.
