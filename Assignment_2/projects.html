                <h2>Self-driving Car - Barnard Programming Labs, J2022</h2>
                <p>In this project, I used python to write code that provides control to a self driving agent in a simulator called Carla. This agent respects traffic lights and other vehicles, navigates scenes making random
                choices when facing an intersection.</p>

                    <h2>Cow Dung Battery - 2018</h2>
                    <p>
                        Motivated by frequent power cuts that happen in Zimbabwe, I built a cow dung battery from the ground up.
                        The battery could power a light bulb using aluminium cans, carbon electrodes and cow dung(as the electrolyte).
                        Although this battery could not power a light bulb for a very long time, it motivated other 20+ students in my village to build similar batteries and to use them to study for their Advanced Level Exams.

                <h2>Bull's eye puzzle - 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    Used Depth First Search to find a solution to the bull's eye puzzle.
                    In this puzzle, the player can only move from blue arrows to red arrows or from red arrows to blue arrows.
                    The goal is to hit the bull's eye.

                <h2>7 X 7 Grid Puzzle - 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    In this puzzle, a player can only move the number of steps which are specified on a square grid and only in the foward direction. The goal is to reach the green square grid.
                    If the player is unsuccessful in finding a solution, the puzzle solver uses Depth First search to calculate a path from the starting position to the green square.
