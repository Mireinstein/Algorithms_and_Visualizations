    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I am a sophoremore studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Amherst College.
       I am interested in Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, and CyberSecurity. I am an aspiring software engineer.
    </p>
    <h2>Biological Sketch</h2>
    <p>Before coming to Amherst College, I lived in Zimbabwe. Here is a brief outline of my life in Zimbabwe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born in Masvingo, and I was raised in the rural areas of Chibi.</li>
            <li>I went to primary school in Chibi and later transfered to Gutu primary school.</li>
            <li>I went to high school at the same institution in Gutu where I studied sciences and self studied commercials.</li>
            <li>After graduating as the top student in my country with six distnctions at Advanced Level, I applied and got into Amherst College.</li>
            <li>At Amherst College, I started studying Math, Physics and Computer Science.</li>
            <li>I am currently studying Mathematics and Computer Science while working as a Math TA.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Outside of class, I play <strong>chess</strong>, and <strong>FIFA.</strong></p>

    <p>
        I like playing FIFA and chess for different reasons. FIFA is a video game that simulates football,
        allowing players to control their favorite teams and players in virtual matches. I enjoy the excitement
        of playing as my favorite team, competing against others and trying to win matches. FIFA provides an escape 
        from the real world, where I can relax and immerse myself in a world of sports. The game is always evolving, 
        with new updates and improvements being made to the graphics, gameplay, and AI.
    </p>

    <p>
        Chess, on the other hand, is a classic strategy game that has been around for <em>centuries</em>. I enjoy the challenge
        of outthinking my opponent and using my strategy and tactics to win. Chess requires <em> deep concentration</em>, focus, 
        and critical thinking skills, making it a very satisfying and intellectually stimulating experience. The game 
        is also a great way to improve my problem-solving skills, as I have to constantly evaluate different moves and 
        anticipate my opponent's responses.
    </p>

    <p>
        In conclusion, I enjoy playing both FIFA and chess for different reasons. FIFA provides a fun escape from the 
        real world, while chess is a challenging and intellectually stimulating game. Both games are great ways to relax, 
        improve my skills, and have fun.
